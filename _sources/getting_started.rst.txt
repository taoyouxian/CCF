Getting Started
===============

Operating Systems
-----------------

At the moment, CCF only builds and runs on Linux. It is primarily developed and
tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

Hardware
--------

Although it is possible to build and run OpenEnclave on hardware without :term:`SGX` extensions,
and run CCF applications in simulation or virtual mode, running with full security guarantees
requires :term:`SGX` hardware with :term:`FLC`.

Azure Confidential Compute
--------------------------

:term:`Azure Confidential Compute` offers CCF-compatible VMs, which can be deployed either through
a `Marketplace App`_, or through the :term:`OpenEnclave Engine`.

.. _`Marketplace App`: https://aka.ms/ccvm

QuickStart
``````````

To quickly get a VM up and running, you can run the following script:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ccf/getting_started/create_vm
    SUBSCRIPTION=$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME ./make_vm.sh

This will create a default ``ccf`` user on the VM, authenticated by ``~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``. If you do
not have a valid SSH key under that path, you will need to either create one, or edit
``vm.json`` to select a different path.

Alternatively, you can follow the instructions in the section below.

OE Engine Walkthrough
`````````````````````

OE Engine offers detailed `deployment instructions`_, but this is a very condensed summary
to get a CCF-ready VM up and running in 5 minutes. You can either execute those steps on a
machine with the `Azure CLI`_ installed, or use `Azure Cloud Shell`_.

1. Download the `oe-engine binary`_ for your platform.
2. Create a definition file as ``vm.json``:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "properties": {
            "vmProfiles": [
            {
                "name": "ccf-test",
                "osType": "Linux",
                "vmSize": "Standard_DC2s",
                "ports": [22, 25000]
            }
            ],
            "linuxProfile": {
                "adminUsername": "ccf"
            }
        }
    }

3. Generate Azure Resource Manager deployment templates. This assumes that you are using an `SSH key`_ to
authenticate, but it is also possible to use a password with adminPassword_.

.. code-block:: bash

    oe-engine generate --api-model vm.json --ssh-public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub --output-directory vm

4. Log in to Azure, set a default subscription and create a resource group

.. code-block:: bash

    az login
    az account set --subscription <subscription id>
    az group create -l eastus -n <resource group name>

5. Deploy the VM

.. code-block:: bash

    az group deployment create --name ccf-deploy \
                               --resource-group <resource group name> \
                               --template-file vm/azuredeploy.json \
                               --parameters @vm/azuredeploy.parameters.json

Dependencies
------------

QuickStart
``````````

To quickly set up the dependencies necessary to build CCF, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ccf/getting_started/setup_vm
    ./setup.sh

Once this is complete, you can proceed to `Building CCF`_.

On a machine without SGX, you can instead use:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ccf/getting_started/setup_vm
    ./setup_nosgx.sh

Details
```````

- OpenEnclave_
- mbedtls_
- boost_ (eEVM_ transaction engine only)
- libuv_

.. _OpenEnclave: https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave
.. _mbedtls: https://tls.mbed.org/
.. _boost: https://www.boost.org/
.. _libuv: https://github.com/libuv/libuv
.. _eEvm: https://github.com/Microsoft/eEVM

Building CCF
-------------

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -GNinja ..
    ninja

.. note:::

    CCF defaults to building RelWithDebInfo_.

.. _RelWithDebInfo: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html

Build switches
--------------

The full list of build switches can be obtained by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -L ..

* **BUILD_TESTS**: Boolean. Build all tests for CCF. Default to ON.
* **BUILD_SMALLBANK**: Boolean. Build SmallBank performance benchmark. Default to OFF.
* **CLIENT_MBEDTLS_PREFIX**: Path. Prefix to mbedtls install to be used by test clients. Default to ``/usr/local``.
* **SERVICE_IDENTITY_CURVE_CHOICE**: String, one of ``secp384r1``, ``curve25519``, ``secp256k1_mbedtls``, ``secp256k1_bitcoin``. Elliptic curve to use for CCF network and node identities. Defaults to ``secp384r1``.
* **NO_STRICT_TLS_CIPHERSUITES**: Boolean. Relax the list of accepted TLS ciphersuites. Default to OFF.
* **OE_PREFIX**: Path. OpenEnclave install prefix. Default to ``/opt/openenclave``.
* **SAN**: Boolean. Build unit tests with Address and Undefined behaviour sanitizers enabled. Default to OFF.
* **TARGET**: String, one of ``all``, ``sgx``, ``virtual``. Defaults to ``all``, which builds both "virtual" enclaves and actual SGX enclaves.
* **VERBOSE_LOGGING**: Boolean. Enable all logging levels. Default to OFF.



Tests
-----

Tests can be started through the tests.sh wrapper for ctest:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd build
    ./tests.sh -VV


Although CCF's unit tests can be run through ctest directly, the end-to-end tests that
start a network require some Python infrastructure.
`tests.sh <https://github.com/microsoft/CCF/blob/master/tests/tests.sh>`_ will set up a virtual
environment with these dependencies and activate it before running ctest. Further runs
will re-use that virtual environment.

Sanitizers
``````````

To build and run the tests with the Address and Undefined behaviour sanitizers, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -GNinja -DSAN=ON ..
    ninja
    ./tests.sh -VV

Build and Test without SGX
--------------------------

CCF can build "virtual" enclaves, ie. binaries that are functionally equivalent,
but do not use SGX. This can be useful when working on non-SGX hardware,
or when using development tools that do not work in an enclave, such as
profiling, code coverage, sanitizers etc.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -GNinja -DTARGET=virtual ..
    ninja

Tests can be run normally, see :ref:`Tests`. On a full build of CCF, it is also possible to
run tests with virtual enclaves by setting ``TEST_ENCLAVE``:

.. code-block:: bash

    TEST_ENCLAVE=virtual ./tests.sh -VV

Tests that require enclave attestation will be skipped.
